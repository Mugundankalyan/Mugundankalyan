## 🚀 Featured Project

### [Real-Time ECG Arrhythmia Classification Using a Transformer Model](https://github.com/Mugundankalyan/ecg_classifier)

- **Overview:**  
  Developed a transformer-based neural network model to classify arrhythmias from ECG signals in real time, leveraging the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.
- **Key Highlights:**
  - Preprocessing pipeline: R-peak detection, windowing, normalization, and data augmentation
  - Custom transformer architecture for sequential ECG data
  - Achieved high accuracy in classifying Normal, PVC, APC, LBBB, and RBBB heartbeats
  - Tested with real-time inference and visualization of ECG signals
- **Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Matplotlib

> _“The detection of arrhythmias in ECG signals is crucial for diagnosing and preventing cardiac conditions. This project demonstrates the power of deep learning in healthcare.”_
